### Lab: The Reading List

Keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read!

- Create an array of objects, where each object describes a book and has properties for the title (a string), author (a string), and alreadyRead (a boolean indicating if you read it yet).
- Iterate through the array of books. For each book, log the book title and book author like so: "The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien".
- Now use an if/else statement to change the output depending on whether you read it yet or not. If you read it, log a string like 'You already read "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien', and if not, log a string like 'You still need to read "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien.'

const books=[
  book1={
  title:"The Hobbit",
  author:" by J.R.R. Tolkien",
  alreadyRead:false
} 
];

for(var i=0;i<books.length;i++){
  console.log(books[i].title+books[i].author);  
if(books[i].alreadyRead==true){
console.log("You already read "+books[i].title+books[i].author);
}
else{
console.log("You still need to read "+books[i].title+books[i].author);
}
}

### Lab: The Movie Database

It's like IMDB, but much much smaller!

- Create an object to store the following information about your favorite movie: title (a string), duration (a number), and stars (an array of strings).
- Print out the movie information like so: "Puff the Magic Dragon lasts for 30 minutes. Stars: Puff, Jackie, Living Sneezes."
  - Maybe the [join](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join) method will be helpful here

const movies={
  title:"One Piece",
  duration:60,
  stars:["Luffy"," Zoro"]
}
console.log(movies.title+" lasts for "+
movies.duration+" minutes. Stars: "+movies.stars+".")
